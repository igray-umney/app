The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a broken React/Vite application into a functional MVP. Initially, the project structure was misunderstood as a full-stack FastAPI/React app, but it was quickly identified as a Vite-based React project. The primary challenge was fixing a severely malformed  with duplicated code and syntax errors, which was resolved by a complete rewrite. Subsequently, the engineer implemented new UI screens, including a comprehensive profile settings page (with child name/age editing, statistics, and streaks), as well as confirmed the functionality of Progress and Library screens. The latest task involved integrating Telegram bot notifications for premium payments. The frontend logic for this was implemented, but it was discovered that the necessary backend API endpoints were missing. The current work is focused on adding these endpoints to the  file, which was recently provided by the user. The engineer has demonstrated iterative development and robust debugging.

The overarching goal was to fix and enhance a child development application. Initially, the primary problem was to analyze and fix critical errors in the  file. This involved resolving issues such as a duplicated React component definition and various syntax errors preventing the application from running. After fixing the core functionality and ensuring the application launched, the user requested the implementation of missing screens. This included a detailed profile settings screen allowing users to change a child's name and age, view statistics (total activities, completed activities, development time, articles), and track streaks. It was also confirmed that Progress and Library screens were to be implemented and made functional. The most recent requirement is to integrate Telegram bot notifications for premium subscription payments, specifically when a user clicks the Pay button within the application, involving both frontend (already done) and backend implementation.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **React**: Core frontend framework for building UI components.
-   **Vite**: Frontend build tool used for development server and bundling.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.
-   **JavaScript/ES6+**: Primary programming language for frontend logic.
-   **FastAPI**: Python web framework for the backend, introduced for new API endpoints.
-   **Node.js/Yarn**: Runtime environment and package manager for frontend dependencies.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application's core structure is a client-side rendered React application built with Vite. It consists primarily of a frontend component, with a recent introduction of a backend component for specific functionality.



**Detailed Directory Structure:**

*   : Root directory of the project.
*   :
    *   : **Important:** This file was recently introduced/provided by the user. It is the main backend application responsible for handling API requests. It's crucial for implementing the Telegram notification endpoints. The previous engineer is currently working on adding  to this file.
*   :
    *   : Defines frontend dependencies (e.g., React, Tailwind CSS, Vite) and scripts (e.g.,  for starting the Vite server). It was used to install dependencies (yarn install v1.22.22

    *   : Configures Tailwind CSS.
    *   : PostCSS configuration.
    *   : Contains the main React source code.
        *   : Entry point of the React application.
        *   : **Most Important:** This is the primary component where almost all UI and logic changes have occurred.
            *   **Initial State:** Contained a full duplication of the  component (starting around line 2817) and a malformed  statement. It also had a syntax error (broken object definition around line 1449).
            *   **Changes Made:** The duplicate component and syntax errors were fixed by a complete rewrite of the file. New sections were added for:
                *   **Profile Settings Screen:** Includes input fields for child name, age dropdown, display of streak, and statistics (total activities, completed activities, development time, articles).
                *   **Payment Modal Enhancements:** UI for Pay by Card and Pay with Stars options. Frontend calls to  (or similar) are initiated from here when payment buttons are clicked.
        *   : Component-specific styles.
        *   : Global styles, includes Tailwind directives (). Confirmed to be properly configured.

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement the backend API endpoints in  to handle Telegram bot notifications for premium subscription payments.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate work being performed is the implementation of backend API endpoints for Telegram payment notifications. The user previously reported that frontend notifications were not reaching the bot because the corresponding backend endpoints were missing. The AI engineer correctly identified this as a backend issue and requested the  file, which the user subsequently provided. Currently, the engineer has accessed the content of the  file and is in the process of adding the necessary FastAPI routes, such as , to this file. This will complete the end-to-end functionality for sending notifications to the Telegram bot upon payment initiation, bridging the gap between the existing frontend logic in  and the server-side processing.
