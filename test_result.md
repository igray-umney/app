# Test Results - Child Development App

## Original User Problem Statement
User reported that frontend payment notifications were not reaching the Telegram bot because the corresponding backend endpoints were missing. The AI engineer identified this as a backend issue and requested the server.js file, which was subsequently provided.

## Project Structure
- **Frontend**: React application built with Vite, located in `/app/frontend/`
- **Backend**: Express.js server with Telegram bot integration, located in `/app/backend/`

## Current Implementation Status

### Backend Endpoints âœ…
The following Telegram payment notification endpoints have been implemented:
- `/api/telegram/payment-notification` - Send payment start notification
- `/api/telegram/payment-success` - Send payment success notification  
- `/api/telegram/payment-cancelled` - Send payment cancelled notification
- `/api/telegram/payment-error` - Send payment error notification
- `/api/telegram/create-invoice` - Create payment invoice for card payments
- `/api/telegram/create-stars-invoice` - Create Telegram Stars payment invoice
- `/api/telegram/test` - Send test notification
- `/api/telegram/status/:userId` - Get user connection status
- `/api/telegram/connect` - Connect user to bot
- `/api/telegram/premium-status/:userId` - Check premium status

### Configuration âœ…
- **Telegram Bot Token**: Configured âœ…
- **Payment Provider Token**: Configured âœ… 
- **YuKassa Integration**: Configured âœ…
- **Environment Variables**: Properly set up âœ…
- **Frontend URLs**: Updated to use environment variables âœ…

### Dependencies âœ…
- **Backend Dependencies**: Installed (express, cors, node-telegram-bot-api, dotenv, node-cron)
- **Frontend Dependencies**: Already configured

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing
1. Verify server starts correctly with Telegram bot connection
2. Test each payment notification endpoint
3. Verify Telegram bot responds to commands
4. Test payment flow integration

### Frontend Testing  
1. Verify frontend connects to backend properly
2. Test payment modal functionality
3. Test notification sending from frontend
4. Verify error handling

## Testing Communication Protocol
- Always test backend first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
- Ask user permission before testing frontend
- Document all test results in this file
- Update implementation status after each test cycle

## Incorporate User Feedback
- User provided all necessary Telegram bot credentials
- User confirmed they want subscription payment functionality via Telegram bot
- No specific notification formats requested - using default implementation
